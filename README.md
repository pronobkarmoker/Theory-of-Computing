# Theory-of-Computing
This GitHub repository contains all the code implementations and practical exercises completed during my Theory of Computing course at IIT, University of Dhaka . In this course, we explore the fascinating world of theoretical computer science, including the study of automata, formal languages, and computational complexity.
